        <h2> about myself</h2>
        <p> Hello, this is XYZ , I am pursuing my yth year BE computer science and engineering from XYZ College
            I am a fast learning personality who can lear anything faster. so that I have been trained in extracurrilar activities from my childhood
            such as Karate(I am a black belt holder in japan wado ryu style), abacus and i have also completed all the nine levels of hindi, So that 
            now I can speak hindi like a native speaker but with a street smart fluency.

    <h2> semester 1 and semester 2</h2>
    <p>In my first year of computer science engineering, I encountered a diverse range of subjects that provided a solid foundation for my academic journey. 
        Physics and chemistry helped me understand the fundamental principles of the physical world, while engineering math 1 honed my problem-solving skills,
        essential for technical disciplines. Python and programming in C introduced me to the world of coding, making me comfortable with logic-building and 
        programming concepts. Additionally, studying the basics of electricals and other engineering subjects gave me a broader understanding of the multidisciplinary 
        nature of engineering, fostering a well-rounded skill set. Overall, the experience was enriching, blending theory with practical learning. </p>

   <section class="exp2">
    <h2>semester 3 and semester 4</h2>
    <p> In my second year of computer science engineering, the subjects became more focused on core technical skills, deepening my understanding of both 
        hardware and software. Operating Systems introduced me to the critical concepts behind system functionality, resource management, and multitasking,
        which are vital for any computer scientist. Digital Principles of System Design helped me grasp how hardware systems are structured, and how digital 
        circuits and logic gates form the backbone of computing devices. Programming in C++ and Java expanded my coding skills, allowing me to learn object-oriented 
        programming and other advanced coding concepts, enhancing my problem-solving capabilities. Engineering Mathematics 3 and Probability and Density Functions further 
        strengthened my analytical abilities, enabling me to approach complex problems with a strong mathematical foundation. Overall, the second year was a challenging yet rewarding 
        experience that sharpened both my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the field of computer science engineering.</p>

            THIRD YEAR
        </span>
    </div>
   </section>
   <section class = "exp3">
    <h2> semester 5 and semester 6</h2>
    <p>In my third year, I studied subjects like Computer Networks, Data Mining, and Object Oriented System Design, which expanded 
        my knowledge of systems and algorithms. Although I couldn't attend some classes due to being in the LeetCode batch, my focus
        on problem-solving and coding paid off. My skills in coding, particularly on platforms like LeetCode, developed much more than 
        I had expected. The combination of self-paced learning and practical problem-solving helped me build a strong foundation in 
        data structures, algorithms, and system design. Overall, this year enhanced both my theoretical and practical understanding of 
        computer science.    </p>
